public class Arrays {
    /*
        Arrays are the simplest data structures which store list of items
        these items get stored sequentially in memory

        if you need to store a list of items and access them by their index then arrays
            are the optimal data structures
        arrays are static, means their size need to be given at time of declaration and
            can't be change afterwards

        time complexity for array operations are as follows
            O(1) -> Lookup using index
            O(n) -> Inserting an element by copying the items in another large array
            O(1) -> Deleting the last element
            O(n) -> Deleting the first element of array and shifting all other elements
                    one index before

        there exist a pre defined dynamic array class in java.util package these are
        vector
        arraylist

        vector are synchronized and can't work with multiple threads but arraylist can
        also vector arrays increases by 100% and arraylist increases by 50%

        arraylist have multiple methods such as
        .add
        .remove
        .indexOf
        .lastIndexOf
        .size
        .toArray -> converts into regular array
