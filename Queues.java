public class Queues {
    /*
        Queue is a data structure similar to stack but in a queue the first item
        inserted is the first item to be removed
        it is called FIFO(First In First Out)

        these are used in situations when there is a resource which is shared among
        many consumers, so these consumers should line up and use the resource one by
        one
        eg Printers, OS, Web Servers, Live Support System

        operations on queue are as follows
        enqueue - O(1) // add to last
        dequeue - O(1) // remove first
        peek - O(1) // return first
        isEmpty - O(1)
        isFull - O(1)


        Priority Queues are queues which order/sort queue based on priority
        no matter at what instance they are added but they are sorted based on priority

        for eg the default priority queue in java for integers sort the items in
        ascending order no matter when they are added and hence when removed they
        came out in ascending order
